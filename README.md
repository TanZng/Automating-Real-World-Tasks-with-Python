## Week 2: Process Text Files with Python Dictionaries and Upload to Running Web Service
Week2.py, this script takes the reviews saved as .txt files on '/data/feedback/' folder and displays them on website. The script to convert those .txt files and process them into Python dictionaries, then upload the data into the website (currently using Django), using the request.post() method to make a POST request to http://\<corpweb-external-IP> /feedback.

## Week 3: Automatically Generate a PDF and send it by Email
Week3/Week.py, we need a summary of the amounts of vehicles that have been sold at the end of every month. So the script sends an email with an attached PDF so that data is more easily readable. The pdf result is the cars.pdf

## Week 4: Automate updating catalog information
Week4/*, we need to upload the new products to the online store. Images and descriptions should be uploaded separately, using two different web endpoints, ans send a PDF report back to the supplier, letting them know what you imported. Likewise, we need a script on the web server to monitor system health, and send an email with an alert if the server is ever unhealthy.
